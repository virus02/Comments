	if request.method == "POST":
		obj=Comment.objects.create(
			name=request.POST['name'],
			email=request.POST['email'],
			website=request.POST['website'],
			comment=request.POST['comment'],
			blog=blogs,
			)

Here, it's actually storing the comment for the specific blog and comments are being filtered to their respective blog from the first line.
And here "blogs" variable is taking the the Blog model ID in the second line and assigning it to "blog" variable where comments are being stored.
So basically how it works is that its taking specific Blog id and filtering it against the comments so comments are being displayed on the Blog
where the user is writing.
